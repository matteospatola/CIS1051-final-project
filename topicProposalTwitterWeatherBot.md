# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Twitter Weather Bot 





## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Twitter bot that will send out a summary weather report at specified time each day 






## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In this project I will construct a twitter bot using the open source python package, Tweepy in order to utilize the twitter API. Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that can access most aspects of the twitter platform. Once I make a working automated twitter bot, I will use the bot to send out summarized weather reports at a specified time each day. I will access real-time weather details through the OpenWeatherMap API. Through this API I can access current weather and forecasts. The daily tweet will include the current weather and the forecast for x amount of days in the future. 





## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable





## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable






## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The project will at least include a twitter bot that automates tweets and allows me to set up tweets to be sent out at a specified time each day. 




### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

By adding the automated detailed daily weather report would add an additional layer to the project and allow me to understand the challenge of using multiple API's in a single program.



 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

in addition to what I stated above I would include interaction with followers/other twitter users in some sort of way.





## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The biggest challenge of this project will be learning how to interact with API's and incorporating them into my programs. Additionally, I want to learn how to incorporate multiple API's and configure interaction between multiple API's to add an additional layer of complexity and sophistication into my software. Also, I want to learn how to automate not only simple commands, but interaction on a platform with users without ever having to manually communicate with said users.
